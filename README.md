# Lifting State in React Notes

In this module, we focus on the concept of lifting state in React applications. Weâ€™ll learn the techniques for moving state up to parent components and how to pass functions down to child components as props. The module also covers the principles of unidirectional data flow in React, exploring its impact on application design and component interaction.
